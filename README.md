# A Programming Platform for Numerical Analysis - Backend

The goal of this project is to learn Numerical analysis through programming. We developed a library of matrix operations and solvers in C++ with no dependencies. We aimed for accessibility and high performance by making a front-end website to demonstrate the operations as well as developing parallel versions of the algorithms.
