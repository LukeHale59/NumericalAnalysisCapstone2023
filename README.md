# A Programing Platform for Numerical Anaylsis - Backend

The goal of this project is to learn Numerical Anaylsis through programming. We did the by devloping a library of matrix operations and solvers in C++ with no dependecies. We aimed for accesiblty and high prefomance by making a front end website to demonstrate the operations as well as developing parallel versions of the algorithms.
